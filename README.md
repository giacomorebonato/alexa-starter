# Alexa Starter (For AWS Lambda)

## Description

This project is a starter kit for creating an AWS lambda function
for a related Alexa Skill.
I am taking many examples from the
[alexa-sdk README](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-nodejs)
and putting those in an `index.ts` file and adding useful comments.

## Usage

```bash
npm install # installs dependencies
npm run build # compiles TypeScript files
```

The Alexa `APP_ID` is passed as an ENV variable.
